The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) describes the numerical ocean models originating
from [NOAA/GFDL](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-model).  They are used to
simulate ocean currents at both regional and global scales, enabling scientists
to answer fundamental questions about the role of the ocean in the dynamics of
the global climate.

MOM6 is the latest version of MOM.  It blends the techniques of traditional
solvers with a dynamic vertical coordinate.  Development is led by an
international consortium of scientists across several goverment agencies and
academic institutions.

For more information about MOM6, visit the
[development website](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6).

MOM5 is the prior release of MOM, based on the hydrostatic primitive equations,
a horizontal [B-grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakawa_grids), and
generalized level coordinates for the vertical.

MOM5 continues to be an active component of many ocean and climate modeling
systems around the world.  Development continues between NOAA/GFDL and its
international partners, with much of the ongoing activity centered in
Australia.

More information about MOM5 is available at this website.  New users can begin
with the [Quick-Start Guide](https://mom-ocean.github.io/docs/quick-start-guide/).

Both models are open source projects released under GPL licenses.
Contributions are welcome.
